When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local in cases,
when i would like to share my project with another people or when i would like to have a 
copy of my repository in different place just in case if something will happen with my 
local place

Why migth you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

I think it may be a good idea always pull changes manually coz in such case I can be sure that 
noone will interrupt my job with their edits
