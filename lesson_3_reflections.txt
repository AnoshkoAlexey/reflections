When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local in cases,
when i would like to share my project with another people or when i would like to have a 
copy of my repository in different place just in case if something will happen with my 
local place

Why migth you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

I think it may be a good idea always pull changes manually coz in such case I can be sure that 
noone will interrupt my job with their edits

Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of 
another?

Branch - we use it when want to add new feature and want to test it along the way, or, for example
when we want to rewrite our code or try new settings 

Clone - we use clone when we want to make copy of local or remote repository on our local machine

Fork - we use fork when we want to make copy on remote repository on remote server

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If we have copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally we can use this information to stay as long 
sync as possible while we are offline.
