What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What value do you think it offers?

I think staging area is different from the working directory and repository in the way, that it allow programmer to commit files in repository one by one or fewfiles at the same time. Operator add does not allow us to do that.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Using operator "git add" i can add all necessary files to staging area and then commit them to the repository at one time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branshes would be helpful in situations when i would try to add some experimental features, or try to add some new language for an application.
In such cases i will make changes only to extra branches but not in master branch.
